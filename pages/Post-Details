1. Applying to Stanford - 
<p>Stanford is one of the most competitive schools in the country, known for its engineering department and sunny weather! In this post, I’ll walk you through the application process. Let’s start with some statistics about Stanford’s last application cycle to get a sense of what we’re up against:</p>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tA1iNS2UbrTtSjZuFCCDsQ.png" alt="Stanford Statistics"/>

<p>With over 47,000 applications and just over 2,000 admitted, Stanford has an acceptance rate of about 4.3%. You can see it’s also a pretty diverse class, with students from across the country and the world. Stanford also has an incredibly generous financial aid program, so don’t let cost stop you from applying! <strong>Although the sticker tuition price is $72,500, the average cost for families making under $65,000 is $4,638/year and for families making between $125,000 and $155,000 it’s $26,551/year</strong>. Next are some important deadlines:</p>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6KhyBbS8VhpmKssyeIsBDw.png" alt=""/>

<p>As you can see, there are two deadlines: one for restrictive early action (REA) and one for regular decision (RD). It’s up to you which cycle you apply for?<strong>if Stanford is your #1 choice, you feel like a competitive applicant, and you’re able to finish your application by the deadline, REA can be a great way to get accepted early and have a stress-free senior year.</strong> (It’s important to note that if you apply to Stanford REA, you cannot apply early to any other private college, although you can apply early to public universities). <strong>On the other hand, if you’re less certain about Stanford and your competitiveness, and you could use the extra time polishing your application and bumping up your GPA, you should consider applying RD.</strong> Now that we have a sense of the deadlines, what are the application requirements?</p>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FmR9Eg73ljQFme-z_EYb0w.png" alt=""/>

<p>Stanford accepts the Common Application, which simplifies the application process significantly. In addition, you’ll need to submit transcripts, letters of recommendation, test scores, and an application fee (you may qualify for a waiver). Let’s take a quick look over the Stanford specific essay prompts on the Common Application:</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>

<li>One Coalition App or Common App main essay (300–600 words)</li>
<li>Three Supplemental essays (100–250 words each)</li>
<li>Eleven short-answer questions (10–150 words each)</li>
<li><strong>Supplemental essay #1:</strong> The Stanford community is deeply curious and driven to learn in and out of the classroom. Reflect on an idea or experience that makes you genuinely excited about learning. (100–250 words)</li>
<li><strong>Supplemental essay #2:</strong> Virtually all of Stanford’s undergraduates live on campus. Write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help your roommate?—?and us?—?know you better. (100 to 250 words)</li>
<li><strong>Supplemental essay #3:</strong> Tell us about something that is meaningful to you and why. (100–250 words)</li>

<p>We’ll talk more about these prompts in detail in a future blog post. In general though, make sure that each of your essays reveal something about yourself that the rest of your application did not?—?remember, you are trying to convince the admissions officer that you would fit right in as a student at Stanford! And be sure to start early on these essays so you can do some extensive editing (preferably start brainstorming now!)</p>

<h4>What standardized tests does Stanford require?</h4>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mFQtrpwRvrg0HiHs7bUKGw.png" alt=""/>
<p>Be sure to take whichever test you feel most confident with out of the SAT/ACT (if you’re not sure, many students elect to take both!) Similarly, it’s advised to take 2 SAT subject tests in your strongest subjects?—?students often take 1 Math subject test and 1 science subject test. Next let’s take a look at Stanford’s advice for letters of recommendation:</p>

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RC9vtIWHF8AaDukPb_X-qg.png" alt=""/>
<p>As per Stanford’s suggestion, you should request letters from grade 11 or 12 teachers since they are most likely to remember you, and you can submit an optional extra letter (perhaps from an athletic coach, or a research advisor). Be sure to ask for these letters early from teachers you have a strong relationship with, and provide them with relevant information about yourself (such as your intended major, why you want to go to Stanford, your extracurricular activities etc.)</p>

<p>Finally, let’s talk about the interview! First of all, don’t panic if you don’t get one?—?sometimes there simply aren’t many alumni in your area. If you do get an invitation for an interview though, get excited! As Stanford puts it, the interview is a “two-way exchange allows you to learn more about Stanford, and the Admission Office to learn more about you.” Be respectful and timely, and most importantly be yourself! Do your homework and come prepared with some thoughtful questions about Stanford for the interviewer. Finally, a thank you note or email afterwards can go a long ways.</p>

<p>These are the basics of the admissions process! It may seem like a lot but if you get a headstart and have a clear picture of the what the process looks like, you’ll set yourself up for success. Good luck!</p>

2. How to Approach the SAT Subject Tests - 
<p>Students are typically familiar with most standard college admissions requirements, such as SAT or ACT scores and supplemental essays. Some colleges, however, also recommend students take SAT Subject Tests, which are standardized tests offered by the College Board on twenty different subjects that can work to highlight a student’s academic strengths in the admissions process. Each test takes one hour and is composed of multiple-choice questions. There are five general section topics?—?including Mathematics, Science, English, History, and Languages?—?and subsections for most. The Mathematics section offers two subject tests, Math Level 1 and Math Level 2, and the Science section offers three subject tests, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. The English section has one subject test on Literature, while the History section covers the two subjects of U.S. History and World History. Finally, the Languages section offers nine subject tests: Spanish, Spanish with Listening, French, French with Listening, Chinese with Listening, Italian, German, German with Listening, Modern Hebrew, Latin, Japanese with Listening, and Korean with Listening. Students may take up to three Subject Tests on one test date, and each test is scored as if it is one section on the SAT test, meaning from 200 to 800 points. Students can visit the College Board website to see which colleges accept SAT Subject Tests, both within the United States and internationally.</p>

<p>To identify which Subject Test is right for you, it is beneficial to consider your academic strengths in high school as Subject Tests cover curriculum from that level. Additionally, if you are taking Subject Tests after already having completed the SAT or ACT, your scores from those tests can be useful indicators of what subject area you would excel in. For example, if you scored very well on the English portion of the SAT or ACT, the Literature Subject Test may be best suited to your aptitude.</p>
 
<p>Preparation for the Subject Tests varies on a student-by-student basis. If you are naturally well versed in a certain subject, you may not feel as inclined to study for the corresponding Subject Test as you would for other standardized tests. However, the most beneficial way to approach Subject Tests is familiarizing yourself not only with the content but with the formatting. Students should become comfortable with the tests’ timing, questioning, and methodology for analyzing multiple choice answers. Practice tests are available on the internet for each of the twenty different subject tests, and are one of the most effective tools to take advantage of when preparing to take the SAT Subject Tests. It is also helpful to remember that although the Subject Tests share similarities with the SAT and ACT, they are different in the fact that they are meant to spotlight your most valuable academic strengths; Subject Tests are oftentimes optional in the college admissions process for this very reason. Therefore, the Subject Tests you choose to take should be on a topic that you naturally excel in, have a strong interest in, or have studied extensively in high school.</p>

3. How to Approach the SAT/ACT - 
<p>The ACT exam is typically comprised of four sections?—?English, Math, Reading, and Science?—?in addition to an optional writing prompt; students are given a total of 2 hours and 55 minutes to complete these sections, and an extra 40 minutes for the optional essay. The English section has 75 multiple choice questions, with a main focus on grammatical and language skills. The Mathematics section is made up of 60 multiple choice questions, ranging from pre-algebra to trigonometry. The Reading section has 40 multiple choice questions which ask you to analyze four different reading passages. The Science section is made up of 40 multiple choice questions covering data representation and research summarization. The highest score one can obtain on the ACT is a 36, with each section being graded separately.</p>

<p>One of the most noticeable differences between the two tests is the fact that the SAT provides students with 43% more time per question than the ACT. The SAT is made up of three sections: Reading, Writing and Language, and Math. Students are given 3 hours to complete these sections, and an additional 50 minutes to complete the optional essay. The Reading portion is broken down into 52 passage-based questions, the Writing and Language portion is broken down into 44 passage-based questions, and the Math portion is broken down into 38 questions where calculators are allowed and 20 questions where calculators are not allowed. The highest score one can obtain on the SAT is a 1600, and the sections are graded independently.</p>

<p>The most useful tool to take advantage of when preparing for the ACT or SAT is practice tests, which can be found for free on the ACT website or College Board website. Once students take practice tests for each, they can get a general sense of which exam best aligns with their academic strengths and time-management skills. Further, these practice tests can showcase specific areas that a student may need to spend extra time studying on as they prepare for the ACT or SAT. While a student may be naturally better at English and Reading in comparison to Math or Science, they can train themselves to understand the most effective approaches to each section through continuous practice. An array of useful online resources exist to ensure that students do not feel ill-equipped to take these standardized tests.</p>

<p>One of the most important parts of the college admissions process is one’s ACT or SAT score, so it is beneficial to start familiarizing yourself with the material and format as soon as possible. Once you identify which test is best suited to your abilities, try challenging yourself to take a practice test once a week, going over your missed answers and developing a strategy that works the best for your unique learning style.</p>

4. What to Avoid in Your College Essays - 
<p>College essays are required when applying to a majority of institutions and are notoriously intimidating to approach. However, you do not need to be an excellent or passionate writer to draft an amazing college essay. To become comfortable with this task, it is beneficial to break the process down into understandable parts. A college admissions essay may prompt students to provide more information about themselves or ask students questions pertaining to their interest in the university. This allows students to provide unique insight on their personalities and their ambitions for the future, as well as have their authentic voices shine through their writing.</p>

<p>When beginning to write your college essays, there are endless tips of advice to follow, points to cover, and boxes to check off. What topics, however, should you <em>not</em> include? Try not to summarize a list of past accomplishments. Colleges have access to your transcripts and resumes; they likely have a sense of your academic strengths already. Rather, use your college essays as opportunities to highlight your character and charisma. If one of your achievements plays a significant role in your personality, then write about it in an compelling way that extends beyond merely recapping the event. Instead, bring yourself back to that moment: explain your feelings and the work ethic that brought you this situation of success. Further, research the university in the <em>right</em> way. While it is easy for students to simply look up and write about the average class sizes and the number of undergraduates in attendance, college admissions offices want to read about your role at the institution, not the facts they are already aware of. Instead, go to the university’s website and look through the academic and extra-curricular programs they offer. Writing about specific courses, majors, and clubs on campus will encourage college admissions offices to picture you at their university.</p>

<p>Remember that college essays should be personal and interesting to read. Admissions offices read thousands of essays each year, so don’t hesitate to write in an engaging manner that extends beyond academia.</p>

5. How to Write the Common App Essay - 
<p>Writing your Common App essay may seem daunting because, unlike other essay prompts, it allows you more freedom in developing your response. Rather than answering a specific question about your interest in a university or your extracurricular activities, this essay prompts you to look inwards, asking yourself how you can effectively convey your personality through writing. Before deciding on the subject of your essay, it is beneficial to ask yourself the following questions: What characteristics make you unique to your peers? What intrigues you about your favorite school subject? What are impactful work experiences you have had? What are your future goals and why? Why should you be offered admission into a university over other applicants?</p>

<p>If you are finding it difficult to select one topic, make a list of possibilities and peruse over them, thoroughly thinking over each one. Picture in your mind what each essay would look like if you were to write them and ask yourself how you would like to be portrayed. Ultimately, the Common App is meant to provide students with the opportunity to show another side of themselves that is not apparent on transcripts, test scores, or resumes.</p>

<p>Arguably the most difficult part of this process begins with perfectly crafting the first sentence of your Common App essay, also known as the killer opening. This sentence should immediately draw the reader in, urging them to continue without disclosing the entirety of your story. So, what makes for an enticing opening? Perhaps the most important aspect is length; your first sentence should be concise and to the point. Look over this example of two killer openings (one stronger than the other) from my own essay. Put yourself in the mindset of a college admissions representative. Try to analyze how each sentence makes you feel. Do you want to read on?</p>

<p><strong><em>Not Good</em></strong><em>: </em>I walked into the building just as the morning prayer was concluding.</p>

<p><strong><em>Good</em></strong><em>: </em>“Amen!” rang out in unison from the motley group.</p>

<p>Evidently, I ended up using the second, better option as the opening sentence of my Common App essay.</p>

<p>After developing an alluring first line to draw your reader in, it is important to keep them engaged with your writing while simultaneously providing them with insight into your personality and authentic voice. Because this essay typically cannot exceed 650 words, you must format your paper well. Use your first paragraph to set the scene and provide descriptive details before incorporating your own character into the essay. Remember to be creative with your writing: as you tell the story, make sure that someone else reading it would be able to quickly identify <em>you</em> within it.</p>

<p>As you wrap up your essay, reemphasize the personal qualities you possess that you believe sets you apart from other applicants. You want the person reading your Common App essay to finish feeling as though they have an understanding of who you are and how you would contribute to the university’s community.</p>

8. Winning Letters of Recommendation - 
<p>"A well-written letter for an outstanding applicant can show impressive characteristics beyond self-advocacy." - <strong>MIT</strong></p>

<p>It sets you apart from the rest of the pool of candidates!</p>

<p>With specifications and anecdotes, a reference gains power. It provides a complete sketch of the student and the context of their accomplishments. It includes information admission committees cannot glean from the rest of the application.*</p>

<p>Universities in the US usually ask for one to three references from the applicants - two from high school teachers and one from the college counsellor or a teacher responsible for the same. Select US universities also allow external letters of recommendation from coaches, job supervisors, and individuals who may have overseen your work or projects. Ensuring that these referees shouldn't have been paid for coaching or training rendered is essential.</p>

<h3>QUESTIONS TO ADDRESS WHILE WRITING A LOR</h3>

10. Choosing The Right University - Study Abroad Counseling - 

<p>College life is an experience whose memories last a lifetime, especially because college is perhaps the only time between youth and adult life. You can live a pseudo suspended life, with as much time for play, as for extracurricular activities. As one steps into the professional sphere, an adult rues the lack of work-life balance, making college life even more memorable.</p>

<p>Everyone has some memories of school: were you the wallflower, the cheerleader, the class brute, or at the receiving end of sniggers from the backbench, all because you did not do your homework? At school, we develop personalities, in relation to others, likes and dislikes, where there's a lesser chance of actually having a voice in choosing the institution. As pre-adults, the luxury of choice means you have the freedom to choose the environment that will best encourage your growth as a student, individual, and, eventually, professional.</p>

<h4>#1 Cultural Fit</h4>
<p>Culture means more than two things. It has more to do with a pathway; the road you take together, is the destination the same? Do you think the school will be a welcoming place for you to learn? Cultural fit means you will feel comfortable 'at home' on campus, with a sense of belonging, which is essential, especially when you are a hundred or thousand miles away from home. Finding and founding new traditions, celebrating the familiar with new friends can be a valuable life lesson as you prepare to be a part of new cohorts, as you move in with roommates at college, join a sorority, graduate to being a professional, seek to date or even start a new family. College is just the beginning of a more significant part of life, so finding a college that's an excellent fit for you can be critical.</p>

<h4>#2 Budget</h4>
<p>Some sections advocate that the more expensive the college, the better the education. Overseas education can be expensive, with expectant parents saving for a college fund right from age 0. However, education lending falls within the priority sector, which means one can borrow at a subsidized rate, with greater freedom to choose the repayment schedule. Also, when choosing from a college list, please ask your advisor to include the best colleges for your program, which may include even the expensive ones. There should be no budgetary stipulation to apply to colleges, especially if you have a solid profile with excellent extracurriculars. Colleges realize that for equal opportunity, they will have to extend financial aid in terms of tuition waivers, scholarships etc. Make an extra effort with the paperwork, be it the Knight scholarship or the Fulbright, from the essays to meeting the requirements, start the profile building early on, and you can still go to an Ivy League college at community college prices.</p>

<h4>#3 Program takes Precedence</h4>
<p>To decide the best program for you, take a pen and jot down your career goals and future income goals; break these down into long-term and short-term goals. Then, begin your research, and go to the microsite for the school of your target university. Check if the school's learning outcomes actually match your own learning objectives and preferred tracks. A program that offers flexibility in choosing two majors and no specific distribution of electives lets you take charge in the driver's seat. If your goal is to end up with a great 401k plan, a house in the 'burbs, and a Cadillac, see if your school has a placement record that has realized these goals for their graduating class. If yes, this is a successful match in streamlining goals.</p>

<p>Students can apply to any college, whether Ivy League or not, as the application fees range between $110 to $380, depending on the school. At this stage, the only thing that the student needs to prioritize is these three factors that will play a vital role in the personal, professional, and holistic development of the student, all of which are the critical drivers for pursuing collegiate education, whether in one's home country or overseas.</p>
